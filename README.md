# Java Case Study â€“ Weather forecast (Finleap)

The repository contains code segments related to a case study on implementing a REST-ful web service for exposing weather forecast (temperature and pressure related) details to the end user. Open weather map (https://openweathermap.org/) is basically the data resource, where the forecast related details are retrieved. The application processes the incoming data and finally the necessary details related to temperature and pressure measurements will be forecasted to the end user.
